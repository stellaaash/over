# I Finally Did It!

Published on: 2025-02-01

I finally got myself to build an actual, working portfolio website (_trying not to jinx this_).

...listen, I know the title is lame but I had to do the classic thing for my first upload!

## New Beginnings

So, **welcome to my brand new blog**! I'd been wanting to create some front-page for myself for a while, now.
I had a few, let's just say, _unsuccessful_ attempts at building something from scratch, like I always want to do.
But I came across the [Astro Framework](https://astro.build) recently, which turned out to be perfect for my needs: **having a simple workflow of Markdown to HTML**.

I wanted something that I can just write blog posts in my favorite text editor, and have it replicated on my website.
Little did I know, this is literally what a lot of tech blogs out there are doing. Yay!

## So... What's Next?

For now, it's pretty bare-bones. As I'm writing this, there's not even an ounce of CSS touching this entire website.
I'll keep working on this project as time goes on, adding more posts and a touch of style to go with it.

Once my blog is a bit more presentable, **I'll make a post introducing myself**, which I know would be redundant with the "About Me" page you see above this text, but I feel like it's the right thing to do.

Hopefully at some point this place becomes the hub of everything I learn and want to rant about, and I hope you'll come on this journey with me!

Have a great day <3
